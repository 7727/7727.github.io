<h7> With juice sluicing downmy chin,I knew the consequences</h7>
<h6>of nearly all my actions.</h6>
<h5>Naivety turned into shame,</h5>
<h4>pushed me up, high into the sky,</h4>
<h3>a trade-off for my stubborn rebellions</h3>
<h2>I was able to touch the heavens,</h2>
<h1>only to brace myselfagainst the steep ride back down.<h1>
