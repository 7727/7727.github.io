  <li> With juice sluicing downmy chin,I knew the consequences</li>
  <li>of nearly all my actions.</li>
  <li>Naivety turned into shame,</li>
  <li>pushed me up, high into the sky,</li>
  <li>a trade-off for my stubborn rebellions</li>
  <li>I was able to touch the heavens,</li>
  <li>only to brace myselfagainst the steep ride back down.</li>
